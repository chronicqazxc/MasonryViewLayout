This demo was inspired by [MasonryLayoutDemo](https://github.com/iosptl/ios7ptl/tree/master/ch05-CollectionViews/MasonryLayoutDemo) from awesome book [iOS 7 Programming Pushing Limits](https://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Pushing-Limits-Applications/dp/1118818342). I made that in my point of view and the following is the explaination of how to implementation the Masonry Flow.
